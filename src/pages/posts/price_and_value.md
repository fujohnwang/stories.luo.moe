# 英文版

A giant ship's engine broke down and no one could repair it, so they hired a Mechanical Engineer with over 30 years of experience.
He inspected the engine very carefully, from top to bottom.
After seeing everything, the engineer unloaded his bag and pulled out a small hammer. He knocked something gently. Soon, the engine came to life again. The engine has been fixed!
A week later the engineer mentioned to the ship owner that the total cost of repairing the giant ship was $20,000.

"What?!" said the owner.
"You did almost nothing. Give us a detailed bill."

The answer is simple:

- Tap with a hammer: $2
- Know where to knock and how much to knock: $19,998

The importance of appreciating one's expertise and experience...because those are the results of struggles, experiments and even tears. If I do a job in 30 minutes it's because I spent 20 years learning how to do that in 30 minutes. You owe me for the years, not the minutes.

一艘巨轮的发动机坏了，船东找来资深工程师检修。
工程师仔细检查后拿出把小锤子，敲了几下。发动机又启动了。
报价2万美元。

船东：“好像没做啥嘛，有详细的账单吗？”

账单发来：

1. 敲击：$2
2. 知道在哪里敲/敲多少下：$19,998

这就是**专业知识的价值**。

**3分钟内做完，是20年钻研和积累的结果**。
